\title{Quadtree Representation of Rasters}
\description{
This package provides functionality for working with raster-like quadtrees
(also called “region quadtrees”), which allow for variable-sized cells. The
package allows for flexibility in the quadtree creation process.  Several
functions defining how to split and aggregate cells are provided, and custom
functions can be written for both of these processes. In addition, quadtrees
can be created using other quadtrees as “templates”, so that the new
quadtree's structure is identical to the template quadtree. The package also
includes functionality for modifying quadtrees, querying values, saving
quadtrees to a file, and calculating least-cost paths using the quadtree as a
resistance surface.

Vignettes are included that demonstrate the functionality contained in the
package - these are intended to serve as an introduction to using the
\code{quadtree} package. You can see the available vignettes by running
\code{vignettes(package = "quadtree")} and view individual vignettes using
\code{vignettes("vignette-name", package = "quadtree")}.

I'd recommend reading the vignettes in the following order: \enumerate{
  \item \code{"quadtree-creation"}
  \item \code{"quadtree-usage"}
  \item \code{"quadtree-lcp"}
}

A fourth vignette called "quadtree-code" is also available. This briefly
discusses the structure of the package. It is not necessary for using the
package but may be useful for those who want more details about the code.
